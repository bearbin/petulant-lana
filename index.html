	<h2>What is this service?</h2>

	<p>This is a service where you can upload your files, pay bitcoins (we use coinbase for the free microtransactions, but you can use a normal bitcoin address) and they stay around with no more payments for ever.</P>

	<h2>Price:</h2>

	<p>The price is {{.BasePrice}} µBTC per megabyte, rounded up to {{.MinumumPrice}} µBTC if the total is lower than that, and adjusted to whatever the actual usage is.</p>

	<h2>Upload your file:</h2>

	<form action="upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" name="file">
		<input type="file" name="file">
		<input type="submit" name="submit">
	</form>
