	<h2>What is this service?</h2>

	<p>You upload your file (max 5GiB for now, will expand later), pay some bitcoins and it will stay hosted here forever, no matter how much bandwidth it gets or how long it's kept for. We use Bitcoin because it's an awesome web currency, and supports the microtransactions we need.</p>

	<h2>Price:</h2>

	<p>The price is 50 µBTC per megabyte, rounded up to 25 µBTC if the total is lower than that, and adjusted to whatever the actual usage is. (40kb would become 25 µBTC, and 2MB would become ~100 µBTC for example)</p>
